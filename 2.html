  <h2>APEX Legends</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" target="_blank" title="apex legends">Apex Legends</a> is a <strong>free-to-play hero <u>battle royale game</u></strong> developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2019, and for Nintendo Switch in March 2021. The game supports cross-platform play. The game is set in the same science fiction universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall series. A mobile version of the game specially designed for touchscreens titled Apex Legends Mobile has also been announced which is scheduled to be fully released by 2022 on Android and iOS.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Apex Legends has two gameplay modes. In Battle Royale, up to 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for weapons and supplies before attempting to defeat all other players in combat. The available play area on the island shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find themselves outside the play area which can be fatal. The final team alive wins the round. In Arenas, players form into three-player squads and fight against another squad in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win when their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.</p>
